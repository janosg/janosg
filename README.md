### Hi there

I am Janoś, an economist with a passion for coding, open-source software, numerical optimization and AI.

My biggest project is [estimagic](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/estimagic), a package for nonlinear optimization. I started it in 2019 and through the help of [amazing contributors](https://estimagic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development/credits.html) it has grown into something larger and better than I ever imagined.

If you find [estimagic](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/estimagic) useful, consider supporting it with a ⭐!
