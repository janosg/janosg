### Hi there

I am Jano≈õ, a researcher at [appliedAI Institute](https://transferlab.ai) with a passion for coding and open-source software.

My biggest open-source project is [optimagic](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/optimagic), a package for nonlinear optimization. I started it in 2019 and through the help of [amazing contributors](https://optimagic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development/credits.html) it has grown into something larger and better than I ever imagined.
